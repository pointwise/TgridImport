TgridImport
==========================================
Copyright 2021 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. All rights reserved worldwide.

This Glyph script reads a Fluent Tgrid file. Each surface mesh zone
encountered will become an unstructured domain. Each imported domain can
be further subdivided along hard edges using a turning angle criterion.
Mesh zone names are applied to domains as boundary conditions. A Tk
interface is provided for file browsing, parameter setting, and progress
monitoring.
